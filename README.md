Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection and prediction of the disease can save lives. 
In this project, we will be building a heart disease prediction model using big data techniques and external big data tools.
The heart disease prediction application can be used by healthcare professionals and individuals who want to assess their risk for heart disease. 
Users will input their health data, which will be processed and used to generate a prediction of their risk for heart disease. 
The application can be used daily as part of routine health monitoring or as a screening tool for individuals at risk.

The data to be worked upon was obtained from below:
Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset
    253,680 survey responses from cleaned BRFSS 2015 - binary classification
